# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our project. This document aims to provide comprehensive information on the system's functionalities, architecture, installation, configuration, and usage guidelines.


### System Overview

Our project  is a web-based platform designed to connect professionals and facilitate networking and job hunting for students. Users can create profiles, connect with others and search for job opportunities.

#### Documents, Features
    - Collaborated with teammates to identify specific functionalities or tasks that users expect to perform within the platform.
    - Discussing feature requests and enhancements proposed by team members, considering their potential impact on project scope and feasibility.

#### Utilize Various Requirement Gathering Techniques:
    - Used prototyping tools to visualize user interfaces and workflows, allowing team members to provide constructive feedback and make decisions on design concepts.
#### Facilitate Requirement Prioritization:

    - Team  discussions to prioritize requirements based on their importance, urgency, and feasibility within project timelines.
    - Used  collaborative decision-making techniques, such as the MoSCoW method (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have), to categorize and prioritize requirements effectively.

#### Document and Maintain Requirement Traceability:

     - Established a centralized repository and documentation platform on Github to capture and organize requirements.
     - Implemented version control mechanisms to track changes and revisions to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
