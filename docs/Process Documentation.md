# Development Lifecycle Workflow

## 1. Requirements Gathering
### Description
In this phase, the team collects, analyzes, and documents the requirements necessary to define the scope and objectives of the UR Connect project. This phase serves as the foundation for subsequent development activities.

### Activities
#### Team Meetings:

- Regular team meetings facilitate open communication and collaboration among team members.
- Active participation from all team members, including frontend and backend developers, as well as the documentation lead.
- Use meetings as a forum to discuss project objectives, clarify ambiguities, and discuss next steps.

#### Documents and Features:

- Collaborate with teammates to identify specific functionalities or tasks that users expect to perform within the platform.
- Discuss feature requests and enhancements proposed by team members, considering their potential impact on project scope and feasibility.

#### Utilize Various Requirement Gathering Techniques:

- Use prototyping tools to visualize user interfaces and workflows, allowing team members to provide constructive feedback and make decisions on design concepts.

#### Facilitate Requirement Prioritization:

- Conduct team discussions to prioritize requirements based on their importance, urgency, and feasibility within project timelines.
- Implement collaborative decision-making techniques, such as the MoSCoW method (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have), to categorize and prioritize requirements effectively.

#### Document and Maintain Requirement Traceability:

- Establish a centralized repository and documentation platform on Github to capture and organize requirements.
- Implement version control mechanisms to track changes and revisions to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Design and Planning
### Description
This phase involves designing the architecture and planning the implementation strategy for the project.

### Activities
#### Architectural Design:

- Define the overall system architecture, including high-level components, modules, and their interactions.
- Consider scalability, performance, security, and other relevant factors during the design process.
- Create architectural diagrams and documentation to communicate the design to stakeholders.

#### Detailed Design:

- Develop detailed design specifications for each component or module identified in the architectural design.
- Specify data structures, algorithms, interfaces, and other implementation details required to realize the design.

#### Technology Selection:

- Evaluate and select appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools for implementing the design.
- Consider factors such as compatibility, performance, community support, and licensing.

#### Risk Analysis and Mitigation:

- Identify potential risks and challenges associated with the design and implementation.
- Develop mitigation strategies to address identified risks and ensure project success.

#### Project Planning:

- Create a project plan outlining tasks, milestones, dependencies, and resource allocations.
- Estimate project timelines and budgets based on the design and requirements.

## 3. Implementation
### Description
Developers write code and implement the features according to the design and requirements.

### Activities
#### Coding:

- Write clean, maintainable code following established coding standards and best practices.
- Implement features and functionality according to the design specifications.

#### Code Review:

- Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality, identify bugs, and enforce coding standards.
- Provide feedback and suggestions for improvement to developers based on the review process.

#### Testing:

- Write unit tests to validate individual components and functions.
- Integrate code changes and perform integration testing to verify the correctness of the system as a whole.

#### Refactoring:

- Refactor code as needed to improve readability, performance, and maintainability.
- Identify and eliminate code smells and technical debt to keep the codebase clean and efficient.

## 4. Testing
### Description
Quality assurance and testing are performed to identify and fix defects in the software.

### Activities
#### Test Planning:

- Develop a test plan outlining the testing approach, objectives, and scope.
- Identify test cases covering functional and non-functional requirements.

#### Test Execution:

- Execute test cases manually or using automated testing tools.
- Record test results and document any defects or issues encountered during testing.

#### Regression Testing:

- Conduct regression testing to ensure that code changes do not introduce new defects or regressions.
- Re-run existing test cases to verify the continued correctness of the system.

#### Performance Testing:

- Perform performance testing to evaluate system responsiveness, scalability, and resource usage under various conditions.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize system performance as needed.

## 5. Deployment and Release
### Description
Completed features are deployed to production or staging environments for release.

### Activities
#### Deployment Planning:

- Plan the deployment process, including rollout strategies
- Coordinate to ensure smooth deployment and minimal downtime.

#### Release Management:

- Manage the release process, including versioning, tagging, and release note preparation.

#### Monitoring and Feedback:

- Monitor the deployed system for performance, stability, and user feedback.
- Address any issues or concerns raised by users promptly and efficiently.

## 6. Maintenance and Support
### Description
After deployment, ongoing maintenance and support activities ensure the reliability and performance of the project.

### Activities
#### Bug Fixing:

- Address reported bugs and issues through timely bug fixes and patches.
- Prioritize bug fixes based on severity and impact on system functionality.

#### Enhancements and Updates:

- Implement requested enhancements and updates to improve system functionality and user experience.
- Consider feedback from users and stakeholders when prioritizing enhancements.

#### Performance Monitoring:

- Continuously monitor system performance and resource usage to identify potential issues or bottlenecks.
- Optimize system performance through tuning and scaling as needed.

#### Documentation Updates:

- Keep documentation up-to-date with the latest system changes, features, and configuration details.
- Provide clear and comprehensive documentation to support users and administrators.
